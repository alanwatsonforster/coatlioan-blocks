# COATLI Blocks
#
# This file defines the blocks that are installed every day at 00:00 UTC.
#
# The fields are:
#
# 1. Priority. A letter, with a being highest priority and z being lowest
# priority.
#
# 2. Duplicates. The number of copies of the block file that are added to the
# queue. This is useful when breaking long observations into shorter blocks.
# Simply set this field to the number times you want to run the shorter block.
#
# 3. Block file. This can be a file name or a shell glob pattern to match a set
# of file names. Omit the trailing ".json".
#
# After the first three columns, it is possible to add a time specification:
#
# - every N M. Add the files to the queue every Nth day of M. Specifically, only
# add the block files to the queue if N = D % M in which D is the day of the
# year (1 to 366).
#
# - on YYYMMDD. Add the files to the queue on the specified date.
#
# If no time specification is given, the block files are added to the queue
# every day.
#
# Empty lines and lines beginning with # are ignored.
